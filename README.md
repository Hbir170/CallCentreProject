In this project, we dive into Call Centre data retrieved from Github and is dated for October 2020. We first clean the data, organize it, run Power Query to fix date issues where the format was not aligning with October 2020 and then began our analysis. By the end of the project, we can tell the client details such as Average Sentiment Per Call Centre, Number of Calls Per Call Centre, Response Time and more based on various filters.
